# MLB Ballparks

Documenting our attempt to visit every MLB Ballpark in the United States &amp; Canada.

## Notes

- I pulled the MLB team logos from [this website](https://www.sportslogos.net/teams/list_by_year/42022/2022_MLB_Logos/).
- I'm using [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the icons.
- Using ESModules with a good [intro here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-es-modules-in-the-browser).
- Using a [`for...of` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).

## Setup

To serve the site locally:

`npx serve src/`

You can optionally specifying a port by passing in a `-p` flag, such as:

Or using Vercel
